# 🌟 Culture Handbook Introduction  
**A clear, accessible introduction to the philosophy and practices that define the Excellence By Design Strategy.**

Welcome to the Culture Handbook — a guide that explains the values, systems, and behaviors that shape our organizational environment.  
This handbook reflects a culture designed with intention, respect, and human-centered principles.  

Our belief is simple:

> **Culture must be built deliberately, not left to chance.**

The Excellence By Design Strategy creates a workplace where excellence is not an accident — it is the automatic outcome of structure, planning, and psychological safety.
